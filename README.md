# distributed-bungee
a WIP solution to for distributed BungeeCord instances. 

## Planned features
 - Distributed solution to manage multiple BungeeCord instances. Using No centralised server/DB and with considerable fault tolerance capability.
 - Provide abstractions for all the bungeecord apis, events. Synchronise state with 3PC trasactions.

## Dev plan
This is a project for personal interest. I'll code when I got time.
Planned to finish a 'working' version before the end of Nov 2018. Plans may change.

## Use of Code
You can freely compile and run the project on any machine you like. For developers, before using the code (re-distribute code, modification etc etc) , you may ask for permissions from me.
